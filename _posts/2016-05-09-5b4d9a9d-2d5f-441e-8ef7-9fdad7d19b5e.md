Electrolytic Drawings are created by a process of coating an insulating material -- Medium Density Fiber Board -- with a conductive electrolyte -- Sodium Chloride in an aqueous solution -- and then passing a high-voltage electrical current through the insulator. Electrical discharges leap from the insulator to the conductive electrolyte causing massive heating and eventual charring of the insulator. The net result is the branching lightning-like patterns seen on these panels. These patterns are known as Lichtenburg Figures, named for their discoverer, German Physicist, Georg Christoph Lichtenburg. Similar fractal patterns may be observed in nature. They are seen in aerial views of rivers and tributaries, and in organic structures like the branches of a tree, a body's circulatory system and within various organs, such as the kidneys, the liver, and the lungs. The similarity of the structures of all of these systems may be a consequence of a recently proposed law of physics known as the Constructal Law, which states that Nature tends to develop a hierarchical branching network of paths that result in the most efficient flow of energy -- of water, of air, of blood ... or, in this case, of electrons.
