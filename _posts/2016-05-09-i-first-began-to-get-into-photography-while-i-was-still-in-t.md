description: 'I first began to get into photography while I was still in the Army. It started as a hobby – a means to blow off stress – but soon thereafter I began to get “voluntold” for details in which photo-coverage of battalion level events was necessary. By the end of 2011, I was appointed as the Unit Photographer for First Battalion, the Third United States Infantry Regiment (The Old Guard). I learned that, while I continued to enjoy photography, I did not want to continue in the press realm of the medium. Upon my medical retirement in August of 2013, I started school at the Corcoran College of Art and Design not really knowing the direction in which I wanted to move. It has come through painstaking experimentation and instruction, as well as earnest autodidactic learning in the fields of Chemistry, Physics, and Mathematics (and other areas of the sciences), that I have reached my current style. I seek to bring into view the curious and wonderful phenomena of the scientific world in such a way that elevates any given particular subject matter beyond the world of the esoteric and into the world of the layman.'

I first began to get into photography while I was still in the Army. It started as a hobby -- a means to blow off stress -- but soon thereafter I began to get "voluntold" for details in which photo-coverage of battalion level events was necessary.
